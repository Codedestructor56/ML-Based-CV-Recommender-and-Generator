It shall provide a list of extracted keywords and their associated weight or importance.
3.3 Vector Similarity <a name="vector-similarity"></a>
3.3.1 Description
The Vector Similarity module will calculate the similarity between CVs and job descriptions using vector representations of the text. This will assist in generating suitability scores for CV-job matches.

3.3.2 Requirements
The module shall convert CVs and job descriptions into numerical vector representations.
It shall calculate similarity scores between vectors using appropriate algorithms (e.g., cosine similarity).
The system should generate a suitability score for each CV-job pair.
3.4 CV Matcher <a name="cv-matcher"></a>
3.4.1 Description
The CV Matcher module will provide a weighted matching mechanism to match CVs with job descriptions. It will produce a score indicating how well a candidate's CV matches a specific job description.

3.4.2 Requirements
The module shall consider keyword extraction results for matching.
It shall assign weights to different criteria, such as skills and experience.
The system shall generate a suitability score for each CV and job description pair.
3.5 CV Builder <a name="cv-builder"></a>
3.5.1 Description
The CV Builder module will allow individual users to input text and generate professional CVs based on their provided information. It will assist users in creating well-structured and formatted resumes. This enhanced version will include AI-powered features such as auto field completion from a resume and an AI prompt engineering module to assist candidates in resume building.

3.5.2 Requirements
The module shall provide a user-friendly interface for entering CV information.
It shall offer customizable CV templates and formatting options.
Users should be able to preview and download their generated resumes.
The AI-powered auto field completion feature shall analyze the user's input and suggest relevant content based on their resume and the job description.
The AI prompt engineering module shall provide context-aware prompts and suggestions to help users craft their CV content effectively.
3.6 Reporting and Analytics <a name="reporting-and-analytics"></a>
